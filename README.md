# Star Wars: Network & Text Analysis

This project explores character relationships in the Star Wars universe through network and text analysis. Using scripts from Episodes I–VI, metadata from Wookieepedia, and SWAPI (Star Wars API), we build a network of character interactions and analyze dialogue patterns across different communities.

The work was done as part of the course **02467 Computational Social Science** at DTU, combining curiosity about the Star Wars universe with data-driven methods.
